# CLI-Hangman

### A command line version of the classic "Hangman" game!

#### Type "node main" in terminal/command prompt to run.
#### The main menu allows you to start a new game, view all possible hangman word choices, or quit.
#### The game only allows valid, single letter entries.  If other characters or a combo of characters are entered, it will prompt the user to re-enter.
#### You have 9 guesses, if you lose you can either play again, or return to the menu - same options if you win.

#### Make sure to install the NPM package "inquirer", all game files must also be in the same directory.  
#### All game logic is built using Constructors and Objects.
